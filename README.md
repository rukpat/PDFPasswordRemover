## How to compile the source code?
The core working functionality is only in the [Program.cs](Program.cs) file and the [registry keys](./blob/main/Installer/ContextMenu.reg). 

Rest of the files are for:
- Visual Studio Code - the IDE and build 
- [Inno Setup](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) - create the installer (see  [https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) for more details)

Compile the code as follows: 
1. In Visual Studio Code open the project folder as  `And folder to Workspace..` or `Open Folder...`
2. Press: `Ctrl + Shift + P`
3. Select `Task: Run Task`
4. Select `Inno Setup: Compile Script` 
This should start the code build and the Installer creation and throw errors for an missing dependency ðŸ˜„ (e.g. **PDFsharpCore Library:**) 

> [!TIP]
> Use your favourite GenAI to debug through the errors.

Installer `PDFPasswordRemoverWinInstaller.exe` file is created in the `.\Installer\Winx64Installer\` folder when it all works.
