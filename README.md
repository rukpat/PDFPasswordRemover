## How to compile the source code?
The core working functionality is in the [Program.cs](Program.cs) file and the [registry keys](./Installer/ContextMenu.reg). 

The remaining files are for:
- Visual Studio Code - the IDE and build 
- [Inno Setup](/Installer/PDFPasswordRemover.iss) - to create the installer (see  [https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) for more details)
- Git related

Compile the code as follows: 
1. In Visual Studio Code open the project folder as  `And Folder to Workspace..` or `Open Folder...`
2. Press: `Ctrl + Shift + P`
3. Select `Task: Run Task` (See [tasks.jason](./.vscode/tasks.json))
4. Select `Inno Setup: Compile Script` (See [PDFPasswordRemover.iss](./Installer/PDFPasswordRemover.iss))

This should throw errors for any missing dependencies ðŸ˜„ (e.g. **PDFsharpCore Library:**) !

> [!TIP]
> Use your favourite GenAI to debug and fix the errors ðŸ˜Š.

When it all works the installer file `PDFPasswordRemoverWinInstaller.exe` is created in the `.\Installer\Winx64Installer\` folder.
